# SoftwareTesting

Q:  How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

A:  I ensured that my software was functional and secure with JUnit tests.  With those tests, I made sure that most lines of logic were tested and accounted for in the original software.

Q:  How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

A:  I make sure that the program includes all of the necessary functions that allow users to interact with the system.  I also make sure that the requirements given allow the user to interact with the program with minimal steps and easy to follow instructions or layout.

Q:  How do I approach designing software?

A:  When I start designing software, I break up the functional requirements into use cases.  This makes sure that the user is put first into the design of the program.  I then break those up into different classes, methods, and fields so that each functionality for the program has its own method.
